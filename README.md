# Collecting data from YouTube using the API v3

## Introduction

YouTube has a rather nice way of programmatically allowing developers to access publicly available data from videos. If your app is showcasing the comments received on specific videos from your channel, automatically pushing content to your app through the API is a great method. 

The access is transparent and allows up to 10,000 requests each day. Practically speaking this translates to collecting data comprehensively from about 200-300 videos per day. That is damn neat. :)

In this repo, the idea is to present notebooks hosted on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) so app developers and researchers can hit the ground running.

## Access

First, head off to [GCP APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/) and get yourself a developer key. All you need is a Google account

## Collecting comments

[This] notebook illustrates how to collect commments from a list of videos.
